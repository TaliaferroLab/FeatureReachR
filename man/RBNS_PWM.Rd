\title{RNA Bind and Seq PWM list}
\format{
A list of named matrices with 131 entries. The name is unique
  refering to both the RBP and its specific motif, the matrix columns
  represent positions, and the rows are the probability of occurance for each
  base "A", "C", "G", and "T". Each column sums to 1. \describe{

\description{
A list of position weight Matrices (PWM) of recognition motifs for RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) as determined by RNA bind and seq RBNS experiments.
RNA bind and seq is an In vitro technique to define RBP binding sites. These
motifs were deined by RBNS experiments performed with 78 purified human RBPs
and random synthetic RNAs.
